Looking at the conversation history:\n\n1. We built a boxing timer app\n2. Made various settings adjustments\n3. User asked to create PR - done\n4. User asked to add combo group selection - done\n5. User asked about scrollable modal - done\n6. User asked about localStorage persistence - done\n7. User asked to commit and push to a new PR - just completed\n\nThe PR is now created. The user has been iterating on features. What would they naturally do next?\n\nLooking at their pattern, they've been:\n- Adding features iteratively\n- Testing things\n- Creating PRs when satisfied\n\nThere's no obvious next step from what they said. The PR is done. They might:\n- Want to test it\n- Want to merge the PRs\n- Want to add another feature\n- Be done for now\n\nI don't have a clear signal of what they'd type next. The task they requested (commit and push to PR) is complete.
