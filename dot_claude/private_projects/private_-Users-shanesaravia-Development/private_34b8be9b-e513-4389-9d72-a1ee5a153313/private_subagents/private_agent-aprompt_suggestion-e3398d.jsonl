User was building a boxing timer app\n2. They made several adjustments (combo prompts, warning sounds, legend)\n3. They asked for a PR, which was created\n4. They then said \"don't push code and make PR's unless i specify this\" - they were annoyed that I pushed without being asked\n5. I updated their global rules\n\nThe user just corrected my behavior and we updated their settings. The task (adding the legend) is complete, the PR already exists.\n\nThere's no obvious next step from what the user has said. They might want to:\n- Continue working on the app\n- Review the PR manually\n- Test the changes\n- Do something else entirely\n\nBut none of these are obvious from context. The user just established a boundary/rule. They'll likely drive what comes next.\n\nI should stay silent here as the next step isn't obvious from what the user said.","signature":"EoIICkYICxgCKkBxwp6y1aY0Uy0Kl20c2sIiPBoFl7eDu9lE1GxgqhecjcEshJRT0b8vnmvwT36SGmgUuRiuYCgOhvdVhAqD4wdeEgx13N2/T+3dhHnxc94aDHFdk3sbI9IwQuC3zCIwhEeVGq3CWeGixWdOtQH5Yx+NHYbxTjEy8Ws8zZj8CVJIO0ZChz0MBK3qz8lAaOy6KukGckkpsWiTN7VgpN8BfpXYkw2/VHzU74yXQs4cTBg5KLFmKRVl2DlTd32Duwc8jXDG1Yl7BgbpMyn4tLBcGxxcGMQdAXymNoFC3xaQew7YITttz87NAHvSEWPTIm1N44hIBiCDrHY21c08j7Jk5kJMP/qQaC3OJzP/Q3PBnC6Nxq8EUNSZ5WVpKrolr77UC2anvo3zjlds817hi0VhGN5mMVxl5IYIPWuENe/WkUf/rLjAR4RtUtbuHdCxY/X7LtPgDXqQ0ttX5Tn1G8vVHBhlJPOtkl/pkimfuWFWmSgSmE+d7moGjueBi2KS+FE3PuWdPeBZBy/+zqy5ZJ36UR8m6IYh9eP5oKPtRWUDHirkCqZ46D0rFmGurJGV2BytbVrQksb4cBhsSxh+izJ3Thn5pSUNew/VypUA8cm1GegR+lQudMeYrFhm+N40H8aC8435NwPQhp5C2J45TPXHyEm5KMIJmGCnuTLnsoSPuE5Hia+DbjeCZDhSjYUrCaji1EsUFO8Xkb88+uL7UojVTeTpM9v/8w3snPdIw1KMWzK8y0tSrTQFLHQbqKGXx0Si2Evtmx6inpD/RbuX52hx7A6eh4n1y28OIpmUHSs05fWDhMIZvn+sQ12en93Z1ehlsn79rwhW/vCg6Cn859Eh8lm1W5FN5FrhMGSLaz4Z6xz3y8W4jR7XQ7TdLaBqT89AJ3/QhMbexeGUXWn2J09og2+YfH0/+dG940bRJy04mY5hj25nqfxy0ecdEwmu/5JF+Ra72slLRW4bTb40+LDc4HCcNuuTdGdDrvTcYHKW/yF8CSlekcVNo0P/4UtUGvaE43JqBKXo6xkC6jxgSmpmvgmIUVuM0ak7+CP1bhBRzfyupBK9Qe/tH8dy7FQo7tmaZGLKmt9yj9NGQThFz7pVz5G5pTI/jfWiNb1RetwJesuvjgBhhfQg4zkuPtuPbZD6ggDhq5aMDZ+QvHNKvIJ6JLSQ0wiE9JmjO7d2Ny2RHV9cB5f7Cxeu60DR8VuBt+gy2PBXntUO8tHnNfP/zeV+xJa7FdRphdfDiS0gJNr8wH7vqw7yus8GY2iTFHLIDPf3XxnZQ+/0Dr0KsIEVF0KloLjsYXdC1t1HKe/BB5oJW9PlG7FIjFQjMEpiisouOkBewkFRw+RNrYPVXhzvGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1407,"cache_read_input_tokens":78451,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1407},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXiQNuK1EWu8CPF4vTvyC","type":"assistant","uuid":"67a41eb3-809a-4fb7-a914-daba6dae0937","timestamp":"2026-02-02T01:50:46.614Z"}
