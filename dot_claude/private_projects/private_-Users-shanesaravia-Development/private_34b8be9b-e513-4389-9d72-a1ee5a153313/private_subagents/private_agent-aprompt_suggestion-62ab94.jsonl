User asked to implement a boxing rounds app following a plan\n2. Claude implemented the full app\n3. User asked for specific settings adjustments (combo prompts interval up to 3 minutes, disabled by default, warning sound setting up to 1 minute with 10 second default)\n4. Claude made all those changes and confirmed they work\n\nThe task seems complete. The user got what they asked for. They might want to:\n- Run the app to test it out\n- Commit the changes\n- Make more adjustments\n\nSince they just made configuration changes, they might want to test it out to see how it feels. Or they might be done and want to commit.\n\nGiven the context, \"run it and test\" or \"npm run dev\" to try it out seems like a natural next step. Or they might want to commit this work.\n\nI'll suggest running the dev server to test it out since they just made changes and would likely want to verify them in the browser.","signature":"Er0ICkYICxgCKkDekrCuIn+vqjVBjlE5dUK6qboqidJaSo96e/ZGhZm8ynjgu7+wuwuUFH2mL6CL79vf7WJya30IdX0IJjV4HX0BEgylznjOHfTh4na7hWQaDI1gusOXtqGsVi+j2iIwr6BT/Hm+2sJRoegwRGb0feOUe0y7mL1fNQLJYQ/k1ZCfe9ILmWLss1vO2t3TIZ6PKqQHh4zBsyS2unt4MI+i6Go/gct3eOnMAmTN/XqULZ0icHcsTBAS8ZHzDGyJNdUN9vZjQy/4QJrdZ7ixbbqyK3ghrQcI+BI8Nn8ncKrkdQFJfnCdWbIqAAsoIAbkB/L77ncaOPsmAqbg76/aOPZSE8/OFaxUebc+F+/AQ+UDM9jWJgMjjFk3LSEwTq4mXimPU66DPcP43nsOUnHyMNUnnfWhDz/VQTKT8PATq/WCGqv/Bi8+nSlDGwEbTwDXv2S9QFsF70Yp4nwx+FUxqgOAxWww9+EjN/8AkJ2wsXwVRS/V4YEdEm7CE4/VawYSeYP9WRIOzGiP6f+uG+0Q6IiKt/bQ73RBM7Le7Lg7bf5FcRe80YpX0w0YJlza2iB3DtlD8yzvqNdkFRBd9C295nUVYDAS5i1TC7tUxfx9mYTjwBBz3cXTYkDmY8GI8gY4qIB1/VDdXzfZWtYIglz6fYd6HjXajtIIGex1egl/O4EfqV6NWp2czaSb5TAxmBpA6vzSbkNxmsjJ3KD4kSp2JFd8w5R5udkkQtqEbM1JKlgcn9LQUYQnXya5a4SiKX1p99wpLOxE+Dvyta97HFBxO5EyhZv8WcTBeBr6xhp69BnwEOg7u8r+SN2dOEDYboxapT1yi1YJ64QX10xIiQ8CLilsPQScH7GknqOe1oVkCYsCtaD5x2osP1lHYpj00fl4bNx8aAY+Mzte5sWIYJ6zPAItsRvbziMxTdSCsfhAQfVXbeUwQRbumJK//n5oLGC7C0IN6e5H9S7P9Jj4pqtuTYZCeKsIQbOuSVYVvEGc/e++3fWGrooB3PT86yvpoUUh/VJSp8yN1X76lnNu7G7rgaCgkuYWNV79UyI74bcPLeAkyu04i79OF7IAv6nmlRrocB/s3x1COppw2usAnfnlMM6H22sf4lcM30rrm3lK5ljz8ts2PoJXycFxsj/mXmn14C8Q2RDUca71XAuXCPMOCafcqOrVzBqth9DrFPRmDgNt1nvn6zBrdyPEnL+oAKvlcvyPXSSWVI/dPzJupjYlaYS8a/mbF352P6Cr2sZuyBP5jEV5T3S123aU/Jx7Ea3D1xuIVSiqi32IgmoCTiM4/1rXSE8Y64Mk8XjdqmqHgwMLinOXmuvmlCS4gIUku5DRbex/x44bEgaHsXx81AnI/KxINK8OYNlAPgW7IMs+EqBR2LbPuwNhCGiixYBIIskUYpWJT0LMXiW5V7Eb5FAdTa6YWghGH+SBC6YYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":39321,"cache_read_input_tokens":17455,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":39321},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXiMaD15fFsSCfgiWaqZR","type":"assistant","uuid":"3e44f5d4-0a85-4c43-aaad-5ed7cee7d3fd","timestamp":"2026-02-02T01:14:00.023Z"}
