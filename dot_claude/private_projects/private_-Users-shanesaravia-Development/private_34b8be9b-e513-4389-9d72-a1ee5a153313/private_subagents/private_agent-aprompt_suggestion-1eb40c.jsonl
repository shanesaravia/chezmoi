They've adjusted:\n1. Combo prompts interval range and default state\n2. Warning sound configurable setting\n3. Immediate combo prompt on timer start\n4. Default interval values\n\nThe app seems feature-complete now with all their requested changes. What would they naturally do next?\n\nPossible next steps:\n- Test the app (npm run dev)\n- Commit the changes\n- Deploy it\n\nGiven the pattern of quick setting adjustments, they might want to test it now to see how it feels with the new defaults. Or they might want to commit since they seem satisfied with the changes.\n\nI think \"run it\" or \"npm run dev\" or \"let's test it\" would be natural. But they could also be done and want to commit.\n\nActually, after all these small adjustments, they might want to try it out to see how the new defaults feel. Let me suggest something like \"let's try it\" or \"run the dev server\".","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":994,"cache_read_input_tokens":63622,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":994},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXiNEFXhCehw3Fe8ZcHnw","type":"assistant","uuid":"9d5a23a7-f302-4e2c-ba44-bde456be1f26","timestamp":"2026-02-02T01:22:35.718Z"}
