User asked to implement a boxing rounds app - done\n2. User asked for settings adjustments (combo interval, combos disabled by default, warning threshold) - done\n3. User asked for combo prompts to show immediately at timer start - done\n\nThe implementation appears complete. The user has been making small refinements. They might want to:\n- Test the app\n- Commit the changes\n- Make another small tweak\n\nGiven the pattern of making incremental improvements to the timer app, and that the last few changes have been small refinements, they might want to test it out or they're satisfied.\n\nActually, the task seems complete - all the features are implemented. The user might want to:\n- run it to test\n- commit it\n\nSince the user has been making small tweaks, they might just want to try it out now. But I'm not entirely certain what they'd want next. Let me stay silent or suggest something generic like \"try it out\" or \"npm run dev\".\n\nGiven the implementation is done and builds successfully, a natural next step would be to test it. But I'm not sure if they want to do that or if they have more changes in mind.\n\nI'll suggest trying it out since the feature was just implemented.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7430,"cache_read_input_tokens":56484,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":7430},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXiMueQ5TLufvMRgZWptX","type":"assistant","uuid":"973a6c77-73fe-4364-bb10-5f85e88a3a4c","timestamp":"2026-02-02T01:18:25.108Z"}
