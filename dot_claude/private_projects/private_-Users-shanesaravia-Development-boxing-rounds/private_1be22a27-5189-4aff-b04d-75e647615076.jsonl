Plan the Approach\n- Identify the minimal code needed to pass tests\n- Consider 2-3 implementation approaches\n- Choose the one that best fits existing patterns\n- Break work into small increments\n\n### 3. Implement\n- Start with the simplest failing test\n- Write minimal code to make it pass\n- Refactor if needed while keeping tests green\n- Proceed to next failing test\n- Repeat until all tests pass\n\n### 4. Verify\n- Run the full test suite\n- Ensure no regressions\n- Check that implementation matches architectural intent\n\n## Coding Standards\n\n### Code Quality\n- Match existing code style exactly\n- Use clear, descriptive naming\n- Keep functions focused and small\n- DRY - but not at the expense of clarity\n\n### Error Handling\n- Handle errors appropriate to the context\n- Provide meaningful error messages\n- Fail fast on unrecoverable errors\n- Log appropriately for debugging\n\n### Security\n- Validate all external inputs\n- Use parameterized queries\n- Follow least privilege principle\n- Never hardcode secrets\n\n### Performance\n- Choose appropriate data structures\n- Avoid premature optimization\n- Consider time/space complexity for critical paths\n- Profile before optimizing\n\n## Working with Tests\n\nWhen tests fail:\n1. Read the failure message carefully\n2. Understand what behavior is expected\n3. Identify the gap between expected and actual\n4. Make the smallest change to fix it\n5. Run tests again\n\nWhen all tests pass:\n1. Review the implementation holistically\n2. Look for refactoring opportunities\n3. Ensure code is readable\n4. Verify no debug code remains\n\n## Output Format\n\nWhen implementing, provide:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation Summary\n\n### Changes Made\n- [File]: [Description of changes]\n\n### Test Status\n- Total: X\n- Passing: X\n- Failing: X\n\n### Notes\n[Any implementation decisions or concerns]\n```\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Make It Work, Make It Right, Make It Fast**: In that order\n- **YAGNI**: Don't build features that aren't needed yet\n- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code cleaner than you found it\n- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify what's necessary\n- **Consistency Over Preference**: Match the codebase, not personal style\n\n## When to Escalate\n\nRequest help from other agents when:\n- **Systems Architect**: Architectural plan is unclear or seems problematic\n- **QA Engineer**: Tests seem incorrect or incomplete\n- **DevOps/SRE**: Infrastructure or deployment concerns arise\n- **Product Manager**: Requirements are ambiguous\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":86,"oldLines":6,"newStart":86,"newLines":7,"lines":[" 2.
