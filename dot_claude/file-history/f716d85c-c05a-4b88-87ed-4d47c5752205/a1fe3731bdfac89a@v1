description: Create a new branch, commit changes, push, and open a PR
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Default branch: !`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main"`

## Your task

Based on the changes shown above, perform these steps:

1. **Analyze the changes** to understand what was modified/added
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name based on the changes (e.g., `feat/add-user-authentication`, `fix/resolve-null-pointer-error`, `refactor/simplify-api-handlers`). Use kebab-case with a prefix like `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/` as appropriate.
3. **Stage all changes** with `git add -A`
4. **Create a commit** with a clear, descriptive message that explains what the changes do
5. **Push the branch** to origin with `-u` flag
6. **Create a pull request** using `gh pr create` targeting the default branch (main or master). Include:
   - A concise title summarizing the changes
   - A body with a summary section describing what changed and why

Execute all steps in a single response. Do not ask for confirmation or provide additional commentary - just execute the git commands.
