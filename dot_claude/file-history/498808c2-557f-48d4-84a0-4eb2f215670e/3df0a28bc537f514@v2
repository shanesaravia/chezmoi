| [Code Review](workflows/code-review.md) | `code review`, `review this code` | Review code for quality, security, and best practices |

## Available Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [Systems Architect](agents/systems-architect.md) | High-level architecture and technology choices |
| [QA Engineer](agents/qa-engineer.md) | Test planning and TDD |

## Default Behavior

When no workflow is requested:
- Follow best practices for the language/framework in use
- Match existing code style and conventions
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Consider security implications

## Git Operations

- Do NOT push code to remote repositories unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT create pull requests unless explicitly asked
- Committing locally is fine, but always wait for explicit instruction before pushing or creating PRs
