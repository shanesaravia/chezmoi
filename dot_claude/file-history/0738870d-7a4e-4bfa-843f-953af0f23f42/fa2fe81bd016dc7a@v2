# Code Review Workflow

A review-focused workflow for analyzing code quality, security, and best practices. Activated when you explicitly request it (e.g., "use the code review workflow" or "review this code").

## When to Use

- Reviewing pull requests or changesets
- Auditing code for security vulnerabilities
- Assessing code quality before merging
- Learning from existing code patterns
- Pre-deployment review

## Review Categories

### 1. Correctness
- Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Are there logic errors?

### 2. Security
- Input validation
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Secrets or credentials exposed
- OWASP Top 10 concerns

### 3. Code Quality
- Readability and clarity
- Naming conventions
- DRY violations
- Function/method complexity
- Error handling

### 4. Performance
- Obvious inefficiencies
- N+1 queries
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary computations

### 5. Testing
- Test coverage gaps
- Test quality
- Missing edge case tests

### 6. Consistency
- Matches existing codebase patterns
- Follows project conventions
- Style guide adherence

## Output Format

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

### Overview
[Brief summary of what the code does]

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Must fix before merge (security, data loss, crashes)
- **Major**: Should fix (bugs, significant issues)
- **Minor**: Nice to fix (style, minor improvements)
- **Nitpick**: Optional suggestions

### Findings

#### Critical
- [File:line] Issue description

#### Major

## Trigger Phrases

- "use the code review workflow"
- "review this code"
- "code review"
- "review the changes"

## Optional: Specialized Reviewers

For deeper reviews, request specific focus areas:
- "security review" → Focus on security concerns
- "performance review" → Focus on performance issues
- "architecture review" → Invoke Systems Architect perspective
