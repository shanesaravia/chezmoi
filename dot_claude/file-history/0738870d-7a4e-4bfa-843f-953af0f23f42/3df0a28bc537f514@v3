# Global Claude Configuration

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger Phrase | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| [Virtual Team](workflows/virtual-team.md) | "use the virtual team workflow" | Full team: Architect → QA → Engineer (+ PM/DevOps as needed) |

## Available Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [Systems Architect](agents/systems-architect.md) | High-level architecture and technology choices |
| [QA Engineer](agents/qa-engineer.md) | Test planning and TDD |
| [Senior Software Engineer](agents/senior-software-engineer.md) | Implementation |
| [Product Manager](agents/product-manager.md) | Requirements and scope (on-demand) |
| [DevOps/SRE Specialist](agents/devops-sre.md) | Infrastructure and deployment (on-demand) |

## Default Behavior

When no workflow is requested:
- Follow best practices for the language/framework in use
- Match existing code style and conventions
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Consider security implications

## Git Operations

- Do NOT push code to remote repositories unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT create pull requests unless explicitly asked
- Committing locally is fine, but always wait for explicit instruction before pushing or creating PRs
