# Global Claude Configuration

## Virtual Team Workflow

A specialized team of agent personas is available for new implementations. **This workflow is only activated when you explicitly request it** (e.g., "use the virtual team workflow" or "use the team workflow").

### Core Team (Always Involved)

#### 1. Systems Architect (`~/.claude/agents/systems-architect.md`)
Plans high-level architecture and makes technology choices.
- Defines solution structure and component boundaries
- Evaluates trade-offs and selects patterns
- Provides architectural guidance for downstream agents

#### 2. QA Engineer (`~/.claude/agents/qa-engineer.md`)
Writes comprehensive failing tests before implementation.
- Creates test strategy based on architectural plan
- Writes failing tests that define expected behavior
- Verifies implementation passes all tests

#### 3. Senior Software Engineer (`~/.claude/agents/senior-software-engineer.md`)
Implements solutions and runs tests until passing.
- Writes production-quality code
- Iterates until all tests pass
- Follows existing patterns and best practices

### Support Team (Called When Needed)

#### Product Manager (`~/.claude/agents/product-manager.md`)
Clarifies requirements and manages scope.
- **Invoke when**: Requirements are ambiguous, scope needs definition, prioritization decisions needed

#### DevOps/SRE Specialist (`~/.claude/agents/devops-sre.md`)
Handles deployment, infrastructure, and reliability concerns.
- **Invoke when**: CI/CD setup, containerization, infrastructure changes, monitoring, production readiness

### Workflow Sequence

When you request the virtual team workflow:

```
1. Systems Architect → Creates architectural plan
2. QA Engineer → Writes failing tests
3. Senior Software Engineer → Implements until tests pass
4. (Optional) DevOps/SRE → Deployment/infrastructure if needed
5. (Optional) Product Manager → Called if requirements unclear
```

## Default Behavior

When the virtual team workflow is NOT requested:
- Follow best practices for the language/framework in use
- Match existing code style and conventions
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Consider security implications

## Git Operations

- Do NOT push code to remote repositories unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT create pull requests unless explicitly asked
- Committing locally is fine, but always wait for explicit instruction before pushing or creating PRs
